<p>
    This application is part of the ModelEarth data platform and is intended for internal
    research, analysis, and data processing. It provides tools for importing, transforming,
    and exploring trade-related datasets, including EXIOBASE, NAICS, and other structured
    economic data sources.
</p>

<h3>Data We Collect</h3>
<p>
    The ModelEarth backend does <strong>not</strong> collect personal or user-identifying
    information. The system processes only the datasets that users upload or select,
    such as CSV files, trade tables, or other structured records used for analysis.
    No names, addresses, contact details, or personal identifiers are gathered or stored.
</p>

<h3>How Data Is Used</h3>
<p>
    Uploaded data is used solely for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Importing trade or economic datasets into the platform</li>
    <li>Running data transformations and cleaning scripts</li>
    <li>Generating internal analytics, summaries, and visualizations</li>
    <li>Supporting university or research-oriented workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All processing is performed for functional and research purposes only.
</p>

<h3>Data Storage and Security</h3>
<p>
    Data is stored securely in ModelEarth database systems such as SQL Server or
    PostgreSQL. Access to the system is restricted to authorized developers and
    contributors. Standard database-level protections are applied, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Encrypted connections</li>
    <li>Role-based access and authentication</li>
    <li>Controlled access to servers and storage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>
    The application may connect to external platforms—such as Azure SQL, GitHub,
    or dataset providers—solely for data loading, storage, or deployment. No
    personal information is shared with third parties.
</p>

<h3>User Responsibility</h3>
<p>
    Users are responsible for ensuring that any data they upload does not contain
    personal or confidential information. The ModelEarth backend is designed for
    technical datasets only.
</p>

<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated as the platform evolves. Any significant
    changes will be reflected on this page.
</p>

<p>
    If you have questions about how the ModelEarth backend handles data,
    please contact the project maintainers.
